[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=GE+Appliances&category=Integration&repository=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fgeappliances%2Fgeappliances-integration)

_Integration to integrate with [GE Appliances](https://www.geappliances.com/) using the [GE Appliances/FirstBuild Home Assistant adapter](https://firstbuild.com/inventions/home-assistant-adapter/)._

This integration works with the [Home Assistant adapter](https://firstbuild.com/inventions/home-assistant-adapter/) (see [here](https://github.com/geappliances/home-assistant-adapter) for firmware) to automatically configure entities in Home Assistant by using [Appliance API](https://github.com/geappliances/public-appliance-api-documentation) to find public ERDs on an appliance. It is designed to be a "batteries-included" option for users who want to quickly and easily get their appliances talking to Home Assistant with the Home Assistant adapter. Users wanting a more customized experience might be interested in [using YAML with the MQTT integration](https://github.com/geappliances/home-assistant-examples) to communicate with their appliances.

## Installation

The preferred method of installing this integration is through the [Home Assistant Community Store][hacs].
